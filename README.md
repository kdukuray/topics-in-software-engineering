# LedgerPay - A CryptoCurrency Payment Processor

LedgerPay is a cryptocurrency payment processor designed to help businesses accept crypto payments seamlessly, much like how Stripe enables online transactions. It provides a secure and efficient way for businesses to integrate cryptocurrency payments without relying on traditional banks.

Businesses can sign up for LedgerPay and receive an API key, which they use to send invoice details to the LedgerPay API. In response, they receive a payment link that they can share with customers, allowing for smooth and secure transactions. The platform supports major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and USDC, ensuring broad accessibility for businesses and their customers.

LedgerPay is compatible with all major cryptocurrency wallets, such as Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and Phantom Wallet, making it easy for users to complete transactions. Additionally, businesses have access to a comprehensive dashboard where they can track payments, analyze transaction data, view their crypto balances, and withdraw funds to offline wallets.

One of the biggest challenges businesses face in adopting cryptocurrency payments is the reluctance of traditional banks to support digital assets. LedgerPay is a crypto-first payment processor that eliminates this barrier, providing a reliable and frictionless solution for businesses looking to embrace cryptocurrency without the restrictions imposed by financial institutions.

## Notes for Future Use of Pull Requests for an Effective Review

1. **Target Branch**:  
   Ensure that all pull requests are directed to the `review` branch, not the `main` branch.

2. **Clear Descriptions**:  
   Any pull request **without a clear message**, description, or comments will be added to a **review report** used purely for metrics tracking.

3. **Code Modifications**:  
   If code is modified outside of one's designated responsibility area, **explanation** for the changes must be provided.

4. **Code Format**:  
   All code must follow this structure for consistency and readability:
   ```python
   # This is an example function to demonstrate the structure of code.
   # A function should include a description of its purpose, parameters, and return values.
   def example_function():
     # Additional code should also be commented for clarity
   ```

5. **Code Readability**:  
   Following this format ensures **better readability** and understanding of the code.
