# LedgerPay - A CryptoCurrency Payment Processor

LedgerPay is a cryptocurrency payment processor designed to help businesses accept crypto payments seamlessly, much like how Stripe enables online transactions. It provides a secure and efficient way for businesses to integrate cryptocurrency payments without relying on traditional banks.

Businesses can sign up for LedgerPay and receive an API key, which they use to send invoice details to the LedgerPay API. In response, they receive a payment link that they can share with customers, allowing for smooth and secure transactions. The platform supports major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and USDC, ensuring broad accessibility for businesses and their customers.

LedgerPay is compatible with all major cryptocurrency wallets, such as Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and Phantom Wallet, making it easy for users to complete transactions. Additionally, businesses have access to a comprehensive dashboard where they can track payments, analyze transaction data, view their crypto balances, and withdraw funds to offline wallets.

One of the biggest challenges businesses face in adopting cryptocurrency payments is the reluctance of traditional banks to support digital assets. LedgerPay is a crypto-first payment processor that eliminates this barrier, providing a reliable and frictionless solution for businesses looking to embrace cryptocurrency without the restrictions imposed by financial institutions.
